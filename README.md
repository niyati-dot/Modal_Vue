# Modal_Vue
â€‹Vue is JavaScript Framework for building user interfaces. Here, in this first project I built a SPA(Single Page Application) Web Page Using Vue CLI (here CLI represents Command Line Interface)

So about flow, single HTML page sent (initially) to the browser, vue intercepts subsequent requests & handles "page" changes in the browser by swapping what components are shown on the page.

Using Vue results in a much faster and smoother website experience
